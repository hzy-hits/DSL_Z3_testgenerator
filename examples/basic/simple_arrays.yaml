rules:
  - name: Active students must have scores
    condition: student_is_active == true
    implies: size(student_test_scores) >= 1
    
  - name: Many courses means many tests
    condition: size(student_course_ids) >= 3
    implies: size(student_test_scores) >= 5

    type: collection
    collection_tests: [empty, single, multiple, boundary]
    
  - name: Boundary tests
    type: boundary
