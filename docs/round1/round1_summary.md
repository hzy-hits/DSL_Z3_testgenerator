# Round 1 Optimization Summary

## Objective
Implement V5 generator to fix critical issues from V4 and improve test generation quality.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed Critical Bugs
- ✅ Test requirements coverage calculation (0% → 100%)
- ✅ Collection type generation (string → array)
- ✅ Boolean constraint parsing in state machines

### 2. Enhanced Features
- ✅ Sequential ID generation (products start from 1001)
- ✅ Business-aware value generation
- ✅ ComplexConstraintParser implementation (partial)
- ✅ Improved test distribution

### 3. Results
- **Average Score**: 66.2/100 (V4: 29.8/100)
- **Improvement**: +36.4 points (+122%)
- **Best Performer**: shopping_cart.yaml (93.8/100)

## Files Generated
- `src/generators/v5_generator.py` - Main V5 generator
- `test_all_requirements_v5.py` - Batch evaluation script
- `outputs/v5/` - Generated test cases for all YAML files
- `docs/round1/` - Round 1 documentation

## Remaining Issues for Round 2
1. Complex constraint parsing (cross-field, temporal)
2. Full test requirements coverage for all files
3. Minor collection handling improvements
4. State machine testing enhancements

## Next Steps
Round 2 will focus on:
- Implementing complete constraint parser
- Adding temporal constraint support
- Achieving 70+ average score
- Enhanced scenario-based testing
